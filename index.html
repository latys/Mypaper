By state converting, the original problem is converted into a state system stability issues at the origin, and then find a suitable parameters by Lyapunov function, and then design a controller. The stability of the system was proofed, and based on the controller calculates the stability region of the wind turbine is running. Finally a wind turbine control simulation platform was built by Simulink, and numerical simulation results show that the control system has good dynamic stability and desired characteristics, indicating that the controller has achieved good control effect and stable operation of the wind turbine within the system stable region. The design method is simple, does not contain the complex control algorithms, has some practical value. Stability region provides a theoretical basis for the operation of wind turbine.</h3>
